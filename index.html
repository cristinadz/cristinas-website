    <p class="paragraph">
      <strong>Oat milk</strong> is a plant milk derived from whole oat grains by
      extracting the plant material with water. Oat milk has a creamy texture
      and oatmeal-like flavor, and is manufactured in various flavors, such as
      sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla or chocolate. Compared to milk and other
      plant-based beverages, oat milk has relatively low environmental impact
      due to its comparatively low land and water needs for production.
